# BIOGRAPHICAL HIGHLIGHTS

## CURRENT POSTING/MISSION
Captain Sel has commanded the U.S.S. Brahe, a Rhode Island-Class Science Vessel, since 2409. Posted originally at the rank of Commander in 2409, Sel oversaw major repairs and refits of the *Brahe* after it was badly damaged during the Klingon War. 

In 2418, *Brahe* was assigned to the 38th Fleet, based out of Deep Space 13 in the Aldebaran Sector, where she participated in a wide array of missions.

In 2419, the *Brahe* was selected to participate in the *Delta Alliance Exploratory Initiative*. After months of refits and in preparation of the project, the *Brahe* entered the Delta Quadrant and arrived at *Telek Station*.

## HISTORICAL NARRATIVE
Prior to commanding the Brahe, Zaliel served as a scientific researcher, programmer, and data analyst at Starfleet Headquaters, where she received several citations for thoroughness, speed, and ingenuity. Showing considerable skill, she was made to supervise and train new officers entering scientifically technical positions, in addition to her normal research and reporting duties. Dissatisfied writing papers for the discoveries of others, Zaliel made several unsuccessful attempts to transfer to an exploratory vessel. Undeterred, Zaliel enrolled in Command School where she demonstrated satisfactory proficiency.

Graduating in 2405, Zaliel was able to successfully transfer to the *USS Atlis* (Intrepid class) as their new Chief Science Officer. Shortly after her appointment, the Klingon War began and *Atlis* was deployed to the Klingon Front. During her four years aboard the *Atlis*, Zaliel participated in over 270 missions directly or indirectly supporting the Klingon War including: Combat Support, Supply Escort, Relief Efforts, and Search & Rescue. For her service and dedication, Zaliel was eventually made Second Officer of the *Atlis* at the close of 2407.

In 2409, *Atlis* detected a faint power signature orbiting a P-Class world which would be identified as the *USS Brahe*, reported missing earlier in the year. Acting under the orders of the *Atlis'* captain, Zaliel was placed temporarily in command of the *Brahe* during the return trip to Regulus. While en route to Regulus, *Atlis* was ordered to return to the Klingon Front. Zaliel was granted the provisionary rank of Commander, with orders to return *Brahe* to port and oversee repairs. For her oversight, diligence, and for want of more experience officers, Commander Sel's rank and position were made permanent in the last days of 2409.

Following the conclusion of the Federation-Klingon War in 2410, Zaliel retained command of the *Brahe*, a position she continues to hold. Over the intervening years, Zaliel would oversee hundreds of scientific mission ranging from astrological surveys to xenological sampling. Using the long periods away from port to her advantage, Zaliel completed two Masters courses via the *Starfleet Distance Learning Program*: Astrophysics and Subspace Theory.

The Spring of 2415 saw the *Brahe* participating in colonization efforts in the Ponor Sector. Representing the colonial effort was Marc Pradhan, a Colonial Civil Engineer, who was responsible for designing layouts for new Federation colonies. Zaliel and Marc quickly developed a rapport and were married a year later at the ground-breaking ceremony on Idious IV, the first colony they helped found.

For nearly a year, between the later end of 2418 and mid 2419, Marc and Zaliel's jobs separated them for a time. While the relationship suffered under the strain, their work once again overlapped with Marc's appointment to the Delta Alliance Exploratory Initiative. Between his connections and Zaliel's credentials, a position for the Brahe was secured. Today, they continue to work jointly to support the DAEI and Alliance presence in the Delta Quadrant.
